My work: Shop Page + Error Page.

Week 1: HTML for one.
Week 2: Styling.

Shop should jump to plant care's relevant subheadings.

Javascript ideas:
Shopping cart - 3hr tutorial to follow, found, understood.
Arrow animation briefly plays when something added to cart.
Dropdown menus with jump to div ids for content.
Subscription letter pop-up with link to registration page?
Thanks for shopping/registration pop-up to indicate successful input.
Mouseover items in shop show floating summaries of each item. Follow mouse?
Error in loading an element takes user to error page, which asks them to refresh. Back to previous page?

DISCUSSION FOR WEEK 10:

- Rather than error page, I'd like to make a sources page.
- Choose plants and write content for them to be added to the plant care page.
- Might not get cart to work, but will try.
- I've used flexbox for my content. I can merge our css sheets?
- Countdown for discount on the shop page using javascript.
- Agree on exact colours. (Menus, borders, content, background)
